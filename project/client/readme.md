# Python Client with C++ parser

Start the client with the `start.sh` script in the `project/client` folder. 

First launch will take a REALLY long time because it has to download and compile the ANTLR C++ runtime library.

Once initialized, the client will start a command line interface where the user can input what they want. Specific commands and restrictions are showed upon entry but can by viewed again by entering `help` command.

Go to `project/client/lexparse` folder to see all the lexer, parser, and visitor codes written in C++. There is another `readme.md` in that folder.

# Lexer and Parser for Cypher in C++

**if running apart from Client, then compile the project before running the first time:**

cd into this folder (`hgx55-pp/project/client/lexparse`), then run

```bash
./compile.sh
```

wait a few moment for it to finish (*near 100MB of files need to be pulled*).
Afterward, you can run the parser either directly by

```bash
./build/cypher-parser.exe
```

or by running the bash file

```bash
./run.sh
```
If you run the program via bash, then the output are available at `hgx55-pp/project/client/IO` as `stdout.txt` and `stderr.txt`.
